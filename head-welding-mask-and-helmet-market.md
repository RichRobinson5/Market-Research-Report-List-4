<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Head Welding Mask and Helmet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Type</li><li>Auto Darkening Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Head welding masks and helmets come in two main types: passive type and auto darkening type. Passive type masks have a fixed shade that does not change, while auto darkening masks have a lens that automatically adjusts to the brightness of the welding arc. The passive type masks are generally more affordable, but the auto darkening type offers greater convenience and protection for the eyes. Both types are essential for welders to stay safe and protected while working on welding projects.</p></p>
