<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noise barrier walls are categorized into two main types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are typically constructed on the ground level to block noise from passing vehicles, industries, or other sources. On the other hand, structure-mounted noise barriers are attached to existing structures such as bridges, buildings, or walls to reduce noise levels. Both types of noise barriers aim to minimize the impact of noise pollution on surrounding environments and communities.</p></p>
