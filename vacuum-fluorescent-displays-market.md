<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Fluorescent Displays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Statically Driven Displays</li><li>Dynamically Driven Displays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum Fluorescent Displays can be divided into two main types based on their driving mechanism - Statically Driven Displays and Dynamically Driven Displays. Statically Driven Displays operate by applying a constant voltage to all segments of the display simultaneously, while Dynamically Driven Displays use multiplexing techniques to control each segment individually by cycling through them rapidly. Statically Driven Displays are simpler in design but may consume more power, while Dynamically Driven Displays are more complex but consume less power and can display more information simultaneously.</p></p>
