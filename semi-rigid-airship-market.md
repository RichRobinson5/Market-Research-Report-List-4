<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-rigid Airship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Helium Airship</li><li>Gas Airship</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semi-rigid airships are a type of airship that have a partially rigid structure, combining the flexibility of non-rigid airships with the stability of rigid airships. The market for semi-rigid airships is divided into two main types: Helium airships and Gas airships. Helium airships use helium gas for lift, which is non-flammable and safer than hydrogen gas used in the past. Gas airships, on the other hand, use a combination of gases such as helium and hot air for lift. Each type has its own advantages and applications within the airship industry.</p></p>
