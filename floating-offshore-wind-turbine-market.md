<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floating offshore wind turbines can be categorized into two main types: horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). HAWTs have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, resembling traditional wind turbines commonly seen on land. On the other hand, VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, offering unique design advantages. Both types of turbines are being deployed in the floating offshore wind market to harness wind energy in deep waters where fixed foundations are not feasible.</p></p>
