<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Compass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-reading</li><li>Distant-reading</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-reading magnetic compasses provide users with real-time information on their heading by directly reading the compass card. These compasses are easy to use and provide immediate feedback on changes in direction. Distant-reading magnetic compasses, on the other hand, use a remote indicator to display the heading information, making them suitable for larger vessels where the compass may be located far from the helm. Both types of compasses are essential tools for navigation at sea and on land.</p></p>
