<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Rolling Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torque Controlled</li><li>Stall Torque</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic rolling motors are categorized into two main types based on their torque capabilities: torque controlled and stall torque motors. Torque controlled motors maintain a consistent torque output regardless of the load, providing precise control over rotation speed. On the other hand, stall torque motors are designed to deliver their maximum torque output at low speeds, making them suitable for applications that require high starting torque. Both types of motors have their own advantages and are used in various industrial applications based on the specific torque requirements.</p></p>
