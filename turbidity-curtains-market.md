<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbidity Curtains Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating</li><li>Staked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Turbidity curtains, commonly used in construction and dredging projects to contain sediment and debris, come in two main types: floating and staked. Floating turbidity curtains are buoyant and designed to float on the water's surface, creating a barrier to contain turbid water. Staked turbidity curtains are installed by driving stakes into the seafloor, providing a secure barrier that prevents sediment dispersion. Both types of turbidity curtains are effective in protecting surrounding areas from contamination during construction activities in bodies of water.</p></p>
