<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Network Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)</li><li>Width Division Multiplexing (WDM)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Network Management refers to the monitoring and control of optical networks to ensure their efficient operation. Two main types of markets within optical network management are Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Wide Division Multiplexing (WDM). SONET is a standardized protocol for transmitting large amounts of data over fiber optic networks, providing high-speed synchronous data transfer. WDM, on the other hand, allows multiple data streams to be transmitted simultaneously over a single fiber optic cable by using different wavelengths of light. Both technologies are essential for the efficient management of optical networks.</p></p>
