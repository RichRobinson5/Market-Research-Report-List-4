<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Ship Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>General Strength Ship Plate</li><li>High Strength Ship Plate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel ship plates are divided into two main types: general strength ship plates and high strength ship plates. General strength ship plates are typically used for the construction of traditional large ships that do not require high levels of strength. On the other hand, high strength ship plates are designed for vessels that require superior tensile strength and impact resistance, such as naval ships and offshore structures. Both types of ship plates play a vital role in the construction of ships and marine structures, catering to different specifications and requirements.</p></p>
