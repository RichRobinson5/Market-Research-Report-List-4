<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Altitude Simulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exhaust Mass Flow 1000-2000 kg/h</li><li>Exhaust Mass Flow above 2000 kg/h</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Altitude Simulators for exhaust mass flow between 1000-2000 kg/h are typically used for smaller industrial applications where a moderate amount of exhaust gas needs to be simulated. On the other hand, Altitude Simulators for exhaust mass flow above 2000 kg/h are designed for larger industrial setups or heavy-duty machinery that require a higher volume of exhaust gas to be simulated. Both types of simulators serve the same purpose of replicating high altitude conditions for testing and calibration purposes, but differ in their capacity and application.</p></p>
