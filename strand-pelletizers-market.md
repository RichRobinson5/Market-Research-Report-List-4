<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strand Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut Strand Pelletizer</li><li>Dry Cut Strand Pelletizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strand pelletizers are used in the plastics industry to cut extruded strands of material into pellets. There are two main types of strand pelletizers: wet cut and dry cut. Wet cut pelletizers use a water bath to cool and solidify the strands before cutting, while dry cut pelletizers use air to cool the strands. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on material characteristics and production requirements. The choice between wet cut and dry cut pelletizers depends on factors such as material temperature sensitivity, pellet quality, and production speed.</p></p>
