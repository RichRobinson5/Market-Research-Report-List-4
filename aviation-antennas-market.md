<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Antenna</li><li>Omnidirectional Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directional antennas are designed to transmit or receive signals in a specific direction, offering higher gain and longer range for communication over longer distances. They are commonly used in applications where the location of the target signal is known. On the other hand, omnidirectional antennas transmit and receive signals in all directions equally, providing a 360-degree coverage area. They are ideal for applications where the direction of the signal is unknown or needs to be received from multiple directions simultaneously.</p></p>
