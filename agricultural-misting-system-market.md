<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Misting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure Misting System</li><li>High Pressure Misting System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural misting systems are categorized into two main types based on the pressure level: Low Pressure Misting System and High Pressure Misting System. Low pressure systems use minimal pressure to create a fine mist suitable for small scale applications. On the other hand, high pressure systems utilize high pressure pumps to generate finer mist particles, making them ideal for large scale agricultural operations. Both systems help in cooling, humidifying, and controlling pests in agricultural settings, but cater to different scales of operation.</p></p>
